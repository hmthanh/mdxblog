# Docs Theme

Nextra Docs Theme is a theme that includes almost everything you need to build a
modern documentation website. It includes a top navigation bar, a search bar, a
pages sidebar, a TOC sidebar, and other built-in components.

This website itself is built with the Nextra Docs Theme.

## Quick Start from Template

### Deploy to Vercel

You can start by creating your own Nextra site and deploying to Vercel by
clicking the link:

<a
className="mt-3 inline-flex"
target="\_blank"
href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra-docs-template&showOptionalTeamCreation=false"></a>

Vercel will fork the and deploy the site for you. Once done, every commit in the repository will be
deployed automatically.

### Fork the Template

You can also manually fork the
[template repository](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template).

## Start as New Project

To create a Nextra Docs site manually, you have to install **Next.js**,
**React**, **Nextra**, and **Nextra Docs Theme**. In your project directory, run
the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
```

Add the following scripts in `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

You can either start the server with, for example if you use npm, `npm run dev`,
which will run in development mode or `npm run build && npm run start` for
production mode.
